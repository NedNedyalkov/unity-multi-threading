=====================

unity3d multi threading helper class with two examples, for indie devs. bring good to the world etc.!

we have an array of 10 grandmas, with an age of 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78. we like to increment the age of every grandma by 1. because we're in a hurry, we use multi-threading and process those 10 grandma items with more cores. 

all files should be well commented. for advanced topics like generics: see links in class or below.
